# whack02-RadarSideQuest

**Variant of [WHACK02-Radar](https://github.com/zheniannn/WHACK02-Radar).**
Identical radar pipeline, with one extra step: **every** WHACK01 trajectory
is rigidly relocated so its origin falls at a random point within 10 km of
the site (stage 5b), then the radar stages run on that set. Every GA flight
in the survey now originates near the radar and fans outward, giving a very
dense scenario (~20k trajectories/day vs ~1.1k in coverage originally — a
deliberate stress test, not a physically realistic traffic density). All
outputs are isolated under `active/sidequest/` and `plot/sidequest/` so
nothing collides with WHACK02.


2D radar measurement simulator built on the ground-truth conventional-GA
trajectories from
[WHACK01-Preprocessing](https://github.com/zheniannn/WHACK01-Preprocessing).
Stages 6–9 form a progressive-complexity ladder for studying track-based
target-vs-clutter discrimination at low CFAR thresholds: stages 6/8 are
clean (fixed vs radar-equation SNR), stages 7/9 add the contamination, so
every effect in the figures has a single cause.

| Stage | SNR | Fluctuation | Meas. noise | False alarms | Clutter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | fixed 15 dB | — | — | — | — |
| 7 | fixed 15 dB | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 8 | radar equation (R⁻⁴) | — | — | — | — |
| 9 | radar equation (R⁻⁴) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Requirements

Python ≥ 3.10:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data layout

Same convention as WHACK01: the data root defaults to `data/` next to the
repository (override with `WHACK_DATA_ROOT`).

```
<data root>/
├── plot/sidequest/            # figures from all stages (isolated)
└── active/
    ├── trajectories_10s/      # WHACK01 stage 4 output (read-only source)
    └── sidequest/
        ├── trajectories_10s/  # stage 5b relocated set (stages 6-9 input)
        └── radar/
        ├── scenario.json      # stage 5 output
        ├── beam_crossings/    # deterministic geometry cache (shared by 6-9)
        ├── stage06/           # per-day truth + detections per stage
        ├── stage07/
        ├── stage08/
        └── stage09/           #   ... + max_range_report.json
```

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/05_radar_scenario.py          # site from the ORIGINAL trajectories
python scripts/05b_relocate_trajectories.py  # build the relocated set (run before 6-9)
python scripts/06_trajectories_clean.py
python scripts/07_trajectories_cluttered.py
python scripts/08_trajectories_radar_equation.py
python scripts/09_radar_equation_cluttered.py
```

Whichever of stages 6–9 runs first computes the beam-crossing cache; the
others reuse it (a fingerprint sidecar recomputes it automatically if the
scenario's geometry changes).

## Stage 5 — `05_radar_scenario.py`

Defines the radar: location, settings, characteristics. Simulates nothing.

- **Site**: centre of the densest 0.25° traffic cell across all days
  (density = sample count = dwell time) → Phoenix/Mesa, AZ. Site elevation
  from the 1st percentile of nearby flight altitudes minus 150 m (terrain
  proxy — no DEM).
- **Radar model**: 2D fan-beam surveillance radar, 10 s scan, 1–80 km,
  0.3–30° elevation fan, 150 m × 1.5° resolution cells, σ_range = 50 m,
  σ_azimuth = 0.2° (≈ beamwidth/7.5, a standard monopulse fraction).
- **Radar physics live on the `Scenario` class**: calibrated radar
  equation (15 dB for 1 m² at 50 km, R⁻⁴), `Pfa(τ) = exp(−τ)`, Swerling-1
  `Pd = Pfa^(1/(1+SNR))`. Later stages only apply this model.
- **Clutter map**: 25 stationary patches (positions frozen here — ground
  clutter doesn't move between days or between Monte-Carlo runs), mean
  SNR 12 dB, within 40 km.
- Everything is frozen into `scenario.json` with the RNG seed; all later
  stages are reproducible functions of that file.
- Emits an **A-scope** figure (`stage05_ascope.png`): echo amplitude vs
  range along one synthesized beam, with the noise floor, the 8 dB CFAR
  floor, a conventional ~13 dB threshold, a near and a marginal far target
  (at mean echo power), and a clutter spike — the picture in which
  "lowering the CFAR threshold in dB" is defined.

CLI: `--range-max-km`, `--threshold-min-db`, `--seed`, `--input-dir`, `--output`.

## Stage 5b — `05b_relocate_trajectories.py`

Reads the original WHACK01 trajectories and the frozen scenario, and writes
a relocated per-day set: **every** trajectory is **rigidly translated** so
its first point lands at a uniformly random location within 10 km of the
radar. The translation is done in
metric ENU (each trajectory's own reference latitude forward, the site
latitude back), so the aircraft's true motion — speeds, turns, path shape —
is preserved exactly and only its geographic placement changes. Verified:
relocated-set speed/turn statistics are identical to the source, and every
trajectory now reaches coverage.

Run after stage 5 (needs the site) and before stages 6-9, which then read
the relocated set. Reproducible from the scenario seed.

## Shared geometry — the beam-crossing cache

A rotating beam hits a target at `scan_start + azimuth/360 × T`, where the
azimuth itself depends on the target's position at that time (solved with
two fixed-point iterations; GA targets move < 1 km per scan). Ground truth
is interpolated to the crossing instant, never extrapolated. Coverage
gating: slant range in [1, 80] km, elevation in the fan (altitude is used
only for slant range and elevation — a 2D radar does not measure it). This
is fully deterministic, so it's computed once into
`radar/beam_crossings/` and shared by stages 6–9.

## Stage 6 — `06_trajectories_clean.py`

**Aircraft trajectories only — no clutter, no noise — at a fixed SNR of
15 dB.** Fluctuation, measurement noise, false alarms, and clutter are all
off; 15 dB always clears the 8 dB floor, so every in-coverage beam
crossing is recorded exactly. The output is the pure per-scan radar view
of the trajectories, and the PPI figure shows clean tracks.

Gate: every crossing detected; targets only; measurements identical to
truth; `snr_db` exactly 15.

## Stage 7 — `07_trajectories_cluttered.py`

**Same fixed 15 dB SNR, now with clutter and noise.** Swerling-1
fluctuation (Pd ≈ 0.82 at the 8 dB floor — *uniform at every range*),
Gaussian measurement noise, Poisson false alarms over the 126,240 CFAR
cells (~230/scan at 8 dB), and the 25 persistent clutter patches. The
figure uses the same 15-minute window as stage 6, so the added
contamination is the only difference.

Gate: Pd uniform across range bins and equal to the fixed-SNR closed form;
false-alarm rate within 5σ of theory; measurement σs reproduced.

`--seed` re-rolls the stochastic layer (Monte Carlo) without recomputing
geometry.

## Stage 8 — `08_trajectories_radar_equation.py`

**Radar-equation SNR, no clutter or noise.** With fluctuation and noise
off, detection is deterministic: a crossing is recorded iff its mean SNR
clears the 8 dB floor, i.e. iff its range is within the closed-form
detection horizon `R = range_ref · (snr_ref/τ)^(1/4)` ≈ **74.8 km**. The
figure shows clean tracks ending exactly at that ring — the radar
equation's range limit isolated from every stochastic effect.

Gate: detection ≡ (range ≤ horizon) exactly; targets only; measurements
identical to truth; `snr_db` equals the radar equation.

## Stage 9 — `09_radar_equation_cluttered.py`

**Full physics: SNR from the radar equation, with clutter and noise.**
Distant targets fade under the R⁻⁴ law (Pd ≈ 1.0 near, ~0.34 at 80 km),
and the stage answers: *what is the maximum range before the radar drops
an aircraft trajectory?* Two limits are computed and written to
`max_range_report.json`:

- **Detection limit** — the range where single-scan Pd falls to 0.5
  (empirical, checked against the closed form).
- **Tracking limit** — the range where 50% of tracks contain a gap of ≥ 3
  consecutive missed scans (a simple track-drop proxy: most trackers coast
  only a couple of scans before deleting a track).

Gates: Pd tracks the Swerling-1 closed form per range bin; false-alarm
rate within 5σ. Figures: the same 15-minute PPI window as stages 6–8, and
the max-range analysis (Pd vs range + broken-track fraction vs range with
both limits marked). Note how the stochastic limits (70.5 / 39 km) sit
inside stage 8's deterministic 74.8 km horizon — fluctuation, not the
radar equation alone, is what actually breaks tracks.

All detections carry their measured `snr_db` down to the 8 dB floor, so
any CFAR threshold ≥ the floor can be applied post-hoc by filtering —
one dataset supports a full ROC sweep.

## Outputs (per stage, per day)

- `radar_truth_<date>.csv` — every beam crossing with measured SNR and
  detection outcome (the Pd denominator).
- `radar_detections_<date>.csv` — what a tracker sees: `scan_idx`, `t`,
  `range_m`, `azimuth_deg`, `snr_db`, `source` (`target`/`noise`/`clutter`),
  plus truth linkage for evaluation only.
- `measurements_summary.csv` — one row per day.
- Figures in `<data root>/plot/`: every stage emits a PPI view of the same
  15-minute window; stages 7 and 9 additionally emit a **B-scope**
  (range vs azimuth, the radar's native frame) and an **RTI** (range vs
  time over 60 min, where targets slope with range rate, clutter draws
  flat lines, and noise speckles); stage 9 adds the max-range analysis.

## Extending

All radar physics: `utils/scenario.py`. Geometry: `utils/beam_crossings.py`.
Stochastic layer and stage recipes (`MeasurementConfig`):
`utils/measurements.py`. The scenario JSON is the single source of truth —
edit it (or rerun stage 5 with flags) and rerun stages 6–9.
